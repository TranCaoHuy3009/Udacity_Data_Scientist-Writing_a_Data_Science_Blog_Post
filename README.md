This undertaking is a component of Udacity's Nanodegree Program for Data Scientists.

## **1- Business Understanding**

We looked into whether North America was a better place than Europe for software engineers to settle down.

To do this, it's essential to comprehend job seekers' objectives; choosing the best place requires taking into account aspects like income, the potential for wage rise, and job satisfaction.

We asked three questions for this: 
- Which location between North America and Europe have higher average salary for software developers?
- Which location between North America and Europe have the higher ratio of salary growth?
- Which location between North America and Europe have the higher job satisfaction?

## **2- Data Understanding**

The data came from [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) the stack overflow 2017 survey.
The Annual Developer Survey investigates all facets of the developer experience, including coding education, preferred tools, version control, and professional developers' employment experiences.

## **3- Prepare Data**

We acquired the data, examined it, and then cleaned it using the Python tools Numpy and Pandas, concentrating on the columns that were of importance to us.

## **4- Data Modeling**

We graphed a number of behaviors associated with the three problems using the Python tools matplotlib and seaborn.

## **5- Evaluate the Results**

Based on the three questions, we arrived to the following conclusions:
- Which location between North America and Europe have higher average salary for software developers?
==> North America 

- Which location between North America and Europe have the higher ratio of salary growth? 
==> Both adhere to the same fashion

â€“ Which location between North America and Europe have the higher job satisfaction? 
==> Overall, we can see that the change in job satisfaction over time is quite similar, but the job satisfaction level is higher in North America than in Europe. And in both regions, there seems to be a trend towards increased job satisfaction with those who spend more time in programming jobs.

## **Libraries Used**
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn

## **File Descriptions**

- EDA.ipynb notebook contains a complete analysis to answer the questions and clearly explains them with visualizations.
- HR-Employee-Attrition.csv file located in dataset/ folder is the original dataset in csv format
